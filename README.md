# Rumbl

The main application created in the [Programming Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4) book. The most up to date content can be found in this previous link. The book is versioned and updates are released to previous buyers 👍

Here's how the authors of the book describe the app:

> Our application will be called rumbl. When we’re all done, the application will
> allow us to take videos (hosted elsewhere), and attach comments to them in
> real time and play them back alongside the comments of other users. Think
> of it as Mystery Science Theater 3000 meets Twitter. At scale, this application
> will be tremendously demanding because each user will record and play back
> comments that must be saved and served quickly so that the content stays
> relevant.

It's an amazing book! Well written, thought-out and exciting content. It has a really nice twist to the traditional web framework paradigm.

If you have any interest in Phoenix or Elixir, just give it a try 😉
